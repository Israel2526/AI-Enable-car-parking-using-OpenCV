### **Problem Statement**
Navigating through congested urban areas often leads to the frustrating challenge of finding an available parking spot. Imagine driving to a bustling shopping mall during peak hours, only to discover the parking lot packed with cars circling around in search of an empty space.

As the minutes tick by, the stress of finding a parking spot increases. The worry of being late for appointments or missing out on a great shopping opportunity looms overhead.

The AI-enabled car parking system, powered by OpenCV, is a revolutionary project in computer vision. Its goal is to automate the parking process by identifying vacant parking spaces and providing an accurate count of available spots.

The system employs a camera and the OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) library to capture live video footage of the parking lot, revolutionizing the way we perceive and manage parking spaces.

### **Pre-Requisites**
To embark on this project journey, ensure that you have the following software versions and packages installed. Building a responsive Python script requires specific packages:

- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/): The Python IDE that simplifies your coding experience.
- [Python 3.7.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/): The programming language version required for this project.
- Numpy: A fundamental package for numerical computations in Python.
- cvzone: A computer vision library that enhances your project capabilities.
- Flask: A web framework used to build web applications.

If you're using Anaconda Navigator, follow these steps to download the necessary packages:
1. Open Anaconda Prompt.
2. Type and execute `pip install opencv-python`.
3. Type and execute `pip install cvzone`.
4. Type and execute `pip install Flask`.

If you're using PyCharm IDE, you can install the packages through the command prompt following the same syntax as above.

### **Instructions**
1. Run the `app.py` file.
2. A localhost web link will be generated.
3. Paste the link into your browser.
4. Voila! The system is up and running.

Revolutionize the way you interact with parking spaces using AI and OpenCV. With this project, the stress of finding a parking spot will be a thing of the past.
